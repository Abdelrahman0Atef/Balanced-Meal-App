# Chat App
**The Goal**<br/>
The goal of this app was to create an ordering app for Balanced Meal, that helps users select the ingredients they want to add to their meal based on their nutritional facts.

## What I Built
I built a modern ordering app where users can choose their ingredients based on their nutritional needs, and the app then provides a meal that aligns with their preferences.

## The Finished App
In the end, I successfully created a functional ordering app where users can select meal ingredients from a list.
